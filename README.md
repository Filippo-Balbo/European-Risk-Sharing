# European-Risk-Sharing
This is a project built in Matlab during my unviersity career. Here the idea is to analyze how the international crossholding of financial assets caused by the increase of the risk sharing thanks to the effect of European Union and European Monetary Union, lead to a gradual disappearance of portfolio home bias in the European Countries.

# European-Risk-Sharing
This is a project built in Matlab during my university career. The idea was to analyze how the international crossholding of financial assets caused by the increase of the risk sharing thanks to the effect of European Union and European Monetary Union, lead to a gradual disappearance of portfolio home bias in the European Countries.

The study is mainly based on the work of Artis and Hoffman in the 90s, and it basically tries to extended the time of their findings. The origingal paper tried to compare EU, EMU and OECD countries to understand if the creation of EU and EMU has increased the international crossholding of financial assets, and so the risk sharing, and to assess whether this helped in the declining of the home bias issue.
Extending the time of their study, has been helpful to understand how this process is developing and how new factors affected the level of international risk sharing.
